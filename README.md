# anopheles_darlingi, October 2024
Whole genome sequence analysis of anopheles darlingi.
This analysis includes darlingi samples from a number of places:
1. Colony samples (Maisa Brazil) with phenotypic data on insecticide resistance status
2. Colony samples from another non-phenotyped colony (holly_wgs_paper_samples, State of Rondônia, (n=12))
3. Wild anopheles mosquitoes from Holly's paper (State of Rondônia were used in this study, one field population from Candeias do Jamari, (n=28)).

Aims: 

Paper one will do a WGS analysi of anopheles darlingi and look for signatures of selection. This will include the wild collected mosquitoes, and the colony mosquitoes.
Paper two will contain an analysis of just the phenotyped colony mosquitoes to assess differences between resistant and susceptible mosquitoes.
